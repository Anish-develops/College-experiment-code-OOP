There are also some striking resemblances between my approach and the
 techniques used by a Russian named Shereshevsky but known simply as S.
 Born at the end of the nineteenth century he was a constant source of bewil
derment and fascination for Russian psychologists. To all intents and purposes,
 he had a limitless memory.
 I can't help thinking that there must be validity in my method when such
 similar techniques have been developed independently of each other by people
 from such different cultures and times.
